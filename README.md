# Building a Simple Calculator with JavaScript
Objective:
Create a fully functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
Allow users to input numbers and operators by clicking buttons.
Display the current calculation in a screen-like input field and update results dynamically.
Key Learning Points:
âœ… Learn how to handle button click events in JavaScript.

âœ… Use DOM manipulation to update the display dynamically.

âœ… Implement the eval() function safely or use an alternative for calculation logic.

Challenge Tasks:

ðŸ’¡ Add keyboard support so users can type numbers and operators.

ðŸ’¡ Implement error handling (e.g., prevent division by zero).

ðŸ’¡ Style the calculator for a modern, sleek UI with hover effects.
